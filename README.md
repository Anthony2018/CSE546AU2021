## About the Course, Prerequisites and Grading
Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from historical data and make inferences about future outcomes. This study is a marriage of algorithms, computation, and statistics so this class will be have healthy doses of each. The goals of this course are to provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental methodologies and algorithms of machine learning.

Prerequisites: Students entering the class should be comfortable with programming and should have a pre-existing working knowledge of linear algebra (MATH 308), vector calculus (MATH 126), probability and statistics (CSE 312/STAT390), and algorithms. For a brief refresher, we recommend that you consult the linear algebra and statistics/probability reference materials on the Textbooks page.

Grading: Your grade will be based exclusively on 5 homework assignments: HW0 (10%), HW1 (20%), HW2 (20%), HW3 (20%), HW4 (30%). There are no exams or credit given in any way other than the homeworks (e.g., no credit given for attending lecture or section). However, depending on whether you are enrolled in 446 or 546, the way the assignments are graded or curved varies (see below).
