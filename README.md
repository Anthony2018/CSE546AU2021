## About the Course, Prerequisites
Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from historical data and make inferences about future outcomes. This study is a marriage of algorithms, computation, and statistics so this class will be have healthy doses of each. The goals of this course are to provide a thorough grounding in the fundamental methodologies and algorithms of machine learning.

Prerequisites: Students entering the class should be comfortable with programming and should have a pre-existing working knowledge of linear algebra (MATH 308), vector calculus (MATH 126), probability and statistics (CSE 312/STAT390), and algorithms. For a brief refresher, we recommend that you consult the linear algebra and statistics/probability reference materials on the Textbooks page.
